#Microscope

This app was developed while reading the [Discover Meteor](https://www.discovermeteor.com/). It is a simple [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) like app in which you can:
* Create an account using `account-ui`.
* Create posts.
* Upvote posts.
* Comment posts.

The book is a great for learning Meteor principles and  how to create a realtime application and deploy it to meteor servers. It is deployed [here](http://another-microscope-app.meteor.com/).
